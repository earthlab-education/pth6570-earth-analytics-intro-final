# Earth Analytics Final: Sorghastrum nutans in National Grasslands
This project examines habitat suitability for Sorghastrum nutans in Colorado's national grasslands.

Soil pH, elevation, and climate data were obtained from POLARIS, SRTM, and MACA2 respectively. Along with a calculated aspect, these variables were used to estimate habitat suitability for S. nutans in 2050.

## Structure
The file "final_project_data_analysis.ipynb" was used to download and merge data, and to create plots and models. All plots and models were saved to the plots folder within this repository.

Due to issues getting hvplots() to appear in html files, a separate portfolio webpage summarizing the findings from the analysis notebook is saved at: The file "final_project_portfolio_page.html". PNG images of static plots are embedded in this file. Interactive hvplots are included as links to separate html files.
