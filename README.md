# Earth Analytics Final: Sorghastrum nutans in National Grasslands
This project examines habitat suitability for Sorghastrum nutans in Colorado's national grasslands.

Soil pH, elevation, and climate data were obtained from POLARIS, SRTM, and MACA2 respectively. Along with a calculated aspect, these variables were used to estimate habitat suitability for S. nutans in 2050.
