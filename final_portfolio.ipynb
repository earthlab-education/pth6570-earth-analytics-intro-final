    "### Pawnee National Grassland\n",
    "Historically, the grassland was inhabited by American Indian groups who hunted bison that grazed in the area (Maxwell, 2020). In the nineteenth century, American Indian inhabitants were forcibly displaced by settlers (Maxwell, 2020). These settlers engaged in agriculture. Farmers in the area removed local grasses, resulted in dry, eroded soil and dust clouds. Many farmers left the area and in 1937, land was purchased from farmed and activities to restore soil conditions and plant life were undertaken by the Soil Conservation Service (Maxwell, 2020). The Pawnee National Grassland was established in 1960 (Maxwell, 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Pawnee National Grasslands occurs on a 30-by-60 mile area, 193,060 acres of which is managed by the National Grassland, with the remainder being composed of private late, State of Colorado land, and the Central Plains Experimental Range (Forest Service, n.d.).\n",

    "### Comanche National Grassland:\n",
    "The history of Comanche National Grassland is similar to that of Pawnee in several ways. The area of the Comanche National Grassland was historically inhabited by the Comanche from 1600s to the 1840s (Maxwell, 2023b). Like in the Pawnee National Grassland, the region's Comanche inhabitants were forcibly displaced by settlers whose poor agricultural practice combined with drought resulted in poor conditions during the Dust Bowl (Maxwell, 2023b).  Like the Pawnee National Grassland, the Comanche National Grassland was created in 1960 when lands restored after the dust bowl were moved to management of the Forest Service (Maxwell, 2023b).\n",

    "\n",
    "Sorghastrum nutans is grazed upon by a variety of species and also provides cover and nesting areas for birds (Brakie, 2017). It is also used for nesting by bees and as a food source for the Pepper and Salt Skipper butterfly (Brakie, 2017).\n",

A bounding box was used so the array was clipped to a rectangluar area containing the grassland.\n",
